#Express Routes
<strong>Language: HTML/CSS/JS+Node.js+Express.js</strong>

My first project in Node and Express!

Create a server via Express and listening for GET requests at a few routes. Use route parameters to capture and respond to url elements.

This is also my first project deployed to Heroku. 

# Update: 

As I continue learning about server-side development, I’ve gone back and added HTML templates to this project (via <a href="http://www.embeddedjs.com/">EJS</a>).

I also created a build system in <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>. For such a small project it was more trouble than it was worth, but I can see this sort of thing will be extremely useful down the road.
